    Return in excess of mean labeling method. Sourced from Chapter 5.5.1 of Machine Learning for Factor Investing,
    by Coqueret, G. and Guida, T. (2020).

    Returns a DataFrame containing returns of stocks over the mean of all stocks in the portfolio. Returns a DataFrame
    of signs of the returns if binary is True. In this case, an observation may be labeled as 0 if it itself is the
    mean. 

    :param prices: (pd.DataFrame) Close prices of all tickers in the market that are used to establish the mean. NaN
                    values are ok. Returns on each ticker are then compared to the mean for the given timestamp.
    :param binary: (bool) If False, the numerical value of excess returns over mean will be given. If True, then only
                    the sign of the excess return over mean will be given (-1 or 1). A label of 0 will be given if
                    the observation itself equal to the mean. Note: if there are any 0 labels (as a result of an
                    observation being exactly equal to the mean for a given time index), np.sign will return a warning,
                    but the function runs fine.
    :return: (pd.DataFrame) Numerical returns in excess of the market mean return, or sign of return depending on
                whether binary is False or True respectively. The last row will be NaN.
